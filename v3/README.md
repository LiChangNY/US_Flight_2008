This repository consists of the following files/folders: 

1. [data](https://github.com/LiChangNY/LiChangNY.github.io/tree/master/d3/v2/data)
  * [2008](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html) flights information data. The original data is about 650 MB so I used Python for processing the data.
  * [airport](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/supplemental-data.html) information including city, state, latitude and longitude. 
  * [script.ipynb](https://github.com/LiChangNY/LiChangNY.github.io/tree/master/d3/v2/data/script.ipynb): For this project, I only used the contiguous U.S. states (thus excluding Alaska and Hawaii). 
2. [js](https://github.com/LiChangNY/LiChangNY.github.io/tree/master/d3/v2/js): .js files
3. index.html: all versions

##Summary
This project visualizes the worst 25 airports (with >1000 flights in 2008) for cancellation and the laregest cancellation reason for each airport. Of these 25 airports, nearly 3 out of 4 are in the Midwest. About half (12 out of 25) airports reported extreme weather as the largest reason for cancellation, closely followed by National Air System (11 out of 25). Although intuitively you would correlate the Midwest's high cancellation rates with the severe weather conditions in the area, the analysis shows "National Air System", which includes non-extreme weather conditions and heavy air traffic, as the main reason for cancelled flights. 

##Design
The visualization is first based off of a geo-map of the reported 25 airports. I used airports with more than 1000 flights in 2008. Circles represent the location of these airports. The circle size indicates cancellation rate. Each circle is colored by the top cancellation reason. Hovering each circle, readers will see a summary of the flight information of a given airport.   

#Feedback
- What do you notice in the visualization? 
- What questions do you have about the data?
- Is there something you don't understand in the visualization?
- Do you find any relationships interesting or counter-intuitive?
- What do you like about the visualization?
- What do you think I can improve on  the visualization?
