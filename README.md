##[d3](https://github.com/LiChangNY/LiChangNY.github.io/tree/master/d3) folder: US Flight Information 2008.
* This project serves to fulfill Udacity P6 Make Effective Data Visualization. Per requirements, I am required to create individual folders for each major revisions. 
* [V5](https://lichangny.github.io/US_Flight_2008/v5/) fulfills the project requirements. But my favorite is definitely [V1](https://lichangny.github.io/US_Flight_2008/v1/), because it's the most dashboardy version. ^^ Happy d3!!
