This project serves to fulfill Udacity P6 Make Effective Data Visualization. I made changes based on peer review and this is the latest version (v5). The final version consists of the following files/folders. Previous versions can be found by changing v5 with v4, v3, etc., in the url.

1. [data](https://github.com/LiChangNY/LiChangNY.github.io/tree/master/d3/v5/data)
  * [2008](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html) flights information data. The original data is about 650 MB so I used Python for processing the data.
  * [airport](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/supplemental-data.html) information including city, state, latitude and longitude. 
  * [script.ipynb](https://github.com/LiChangNY/LiChangNY.github.io/tree/master/d3/v5/data/script.ipynb): Script to process the data to the ideal format.

##Summary
This project visualizes cancellation rate and largest cancellation reason for the 25 busiest airports by number of flights in 2008. About two-thirds of these 25 airports are located in the [states by coastline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_coastline), indicating the geographic advantage of coastal cities in the hub-and-spoke airline system. As indicated by the bubble size, on average, airports in the west coast have lower cancellation rates as compared to those in the east coast. Nearly two-thirds (16 out of 25) of these hub airports reported carrier-related causes including aircraft maintenance, baggage loading, and fueling, etc.,(read more [here](http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/help/aviation/html/understanding.html)), as the main reason for cancelled flights.

##Design
The reason why I chose to use a map is because it's very easy to find any patterns related to location, which is one of the most important messages I want to communicate to readers. 

I had also thought about using three bar charts, with the first one showing number of flights, the second one showing cancellation rate, and the third one showing the largest cancellations reason. But as compared to a map where I can combine multiple visual encodings, such as shape, color, and size on one plot, the decision wasn't a hard one to make. So here is my final design: The visualization is based off of a geo-map of the 25 busiest airports in 2008. Circles represent the location of these airports. The circle size indicates cancellation rate. Each circle is colored by the top cancellation reason. Hovering each circle, readers will see a summary of the flight information of a given airport.   


#Feedback
I posted different versions to Udacity Forum and received feedback from 3 people as documented below. 
  
###[Feedback](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/project-6-feedback-request-us-flight-information-2008/31275) on [v1](http://lichangny.github.io/d3/v1/index.html)

The first version provides information such as number of flights between two airports, the percentage of cancellation, delay (both departure and arrival) and diversion rate, for all the airports.

@bhavin_32916782826d Udacity user: *Your visualisation is nicely laid out and very clear in presenting the data. However, I think it is exploratory in nature. For the project to meet expectations, the viz has to be explanatory, i.e., author-driven. So you will have to find patterns and interesting stories in the data and present them to the user, rather than let the user find something interesting. I just completed my project, which was initially explanatory-exploratory. I had to to create a better narrative to meet expectations. Hope this helps.*

I didn't read the project instructions clearly so the first version is really exploratory in nature. Hence, I switched gears to visualize on 25 worst airports for cancellations.

###[Feedback](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/project-6-feedback-request-25-worst-airports-for-cancellations-2008/32165) on [v2](http://lichangny.github.io/d3/v2/index.html)

The second version visualizes the worst 25 airports (with >1000 flights in 2008) for cancellation and the laregest cancellation reason for each airport.

@bhavin_329167828 Udacity user: *Your visualization is definitely explanatory in nature, and the visual encodings are clear. I think as-is you may probably meet all expectations. I do have a suggestion, if I may:
I noticed that except LaGuardia, all the other airports in your viz are small and regional. Since US air travel has a hub-and-spoke system, I feel you could broaden the appeal of your viz by limiting it to just the 25 busiest airports in America, which would all be hubs. It would be a great tool for most air travellers in the US in deciding what hub to connect through.
You would also be comparing airports that have similar passenger traffic, so that it is a fair comparison.*

Response from me: *Hi, Bhavin. Thank you so much for your comment. I think your suggestion on visualizing 25 busiest airports sounds great. However, after I made changes by limiting to just the 25 busiest airports, I realize that it poses a challenge in the visual encodings. Here is the link: http://lichangny.github.io/d3/v3/ . Some circles, as decided by the cancellation rate, either overlap with each other significantly when I use a big magnifier or appears super small with a small magnifier , which reduces the readability of the viz....I'm all ears if you have any recommendations on how to improve on the v3 codes.*

Follow up from @bhavin_329167828: *Mike Bostock suggests that you can overcome the problem of overlapping by always putting smaller bubbles over larger bubbles. Please see the data viz #6 at this link, where he discusses the problem of occlusion. http://bost.ocks.org/mike/bubble-map/6 The lie-factor on the bubbles seems to be greater than 1. If you notice, the area for the 3% bubble is more than 3x larger than the area of the 1% bubble. You can easily fix that by using the square root of the cancellation rate.*

###[Feedback](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/project-6-feedback-request-25-worst-airports-for-cancellations-2008/32165) on [v3](http://lichangny.github.io/d3/v3/index.html)

Based off of Bhavin's feedback, I changed the theme of the visualization again to 25 busiest airports and applied some formatting changes in [v3](http://lichangny.github.io/d3/v3/index.html). 

@Charlie Udacity coach has quite a few comments. I combined her questions and my responses together below. The changes are applied in [v4](http://lichangny.github.io/d3/v4/index.html):

*I think you've got a couple of interesting points in there, which your text did a good job of highlighting:*
- *The spread of the busiest airports in the US*
- *Weather seems to cause cancellations mostly on the south and central parts of the US*
*Overall, I enjoyed looking at your visualisation - well done! I like the use of text and map together.*

*However there were a few things that confused me that you could improve*
- *In the text you say "Of these 25 airports, nearly 3 out of 4 are located near the coast". Firstly, it's confusing because you say "Of these 25" then immediately "out of 4" - can you give this out of 25 for clarity? Secondly, I'm not sure this is true. It doesn't look to me as though 3/4 of the airports are near the coast. How do you define 'near the coast'?*

LC: *Sorry for the confusion. I mistakenly counted McCarran (NV) and Phoenix Sky Harbor (AZ) as in coastal states but Nevada and Arizona are not, based on the wiki page. I've corrected them.*

- *Somewhat similarly, 'More than three-thirds (16 out of 25)' doesn't seem correct. 16/25 is less than two thirds, certainly not more than three thirds.*

LC: *Corrected as "About two-thirds". Sorry for the typo.*

- *What does CXL mean? It seems unnecessary to obscure meaning here.*

LC: *It's supposed to short for cancellation. Since it caused confusion, I changed CXL to Cancellation.* 

- *Whilst it's nice that you added a link to more explanation of the various causes of cancellation, I think you could include a explanation of this within the visualisation to save the viewer having to go elsewhere.*

LC: *Added some examples.*

- *In the legend there is a red circle for 'security' but I don't see any red circles on the map. Why is this included?*

LC: *Security was one of the four cancellation codes in the original dataset. But none of 25 busiest airports reported security as the biggest reason for cancellation (which is good :)). I've removed it from the graph.*

- *I think the plot still suffers from overplotting - perhaps the use of transparency and edging is adding to this problem? I think that it might be better to change the transparency on mouseover so that the highlighted circle is bright, rather than changing its colour (where there is overplotting, it makes it even more difficult to see).*

LC: *I changed to a lighter edge. As for transparency, in the beginning I wasnâ€™t very in favor of solid colors because a few circles overlap with each other. But now when I use non-transparent color instead of changing to yellow on mouseover, it does look much nicer. The mouse-over circle stands out even more.*

- *The transparency on the tooltip text also makes this a little hard to see. Could you change the placement of this text, or make its background more opaque?*

LC: *I increased the font size as well as the placement.*

After this revision, Charlie replied that I have addressed all her comments. I then showed the fourth version to the last reviewer-my husband. 

### Feedback on [v4](http://lichangny.github.io/d3/v4/index.html)

Here is what my husband wrote based on the guiding questions:
  - What do you notice in the visualization?: *Lots of cancellations on the east coast.* 
  - Is there something you don't understand in the visualization?: *No*
  - Do you find any relationships interesting or counter-intuitive?: *West coast not affected by weather (or earthquakes?). Kentucky has extreme weather?*
  - What do you like about the visualization?: *Very clear and self-explanatory. Easy to see patterns.*
  - What do you think I can improve on the visualization?: *Hard to read hovered text when there is other stuff behind it (other circles/lines).*
  
I think my husband made a good point that the tooltip is kinda hard to see in places where there are many circles. So I adjusted canvas size, added white background to tooltip and adjusted tooltip positions. 

This concludes the peer review process and here is the final version [v5](http://lichangny.github.io/d3/v5/index.html).
